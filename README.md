# Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

## Computational analysis reveals similarities and differences between SCLC subtypes

Datasets CCLE, GSE73160, GSE7097, GSE10841, GSE45120, GSE62609, GSE66294 & GSE144457 need to be downloaded into the "Datasets" folder. In case of multiple probes, for microarray data, median expression was considered.

ssGSEA scores were generated using the ssgsea-gui.R script available [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/ssGSEA2.0/blob/master/ssgsea-gui.R)

**Note:** Use Transcripts Per Million (TPM) noramalized RNA-seq dataset for ssGSEA 

## Programming languages used in this analysis
```
R version 4.0.4 

Bioconductor version 3.11

Python version 3.8.3
```
